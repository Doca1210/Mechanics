# Pipeline for the extraction of visually evoked potentials 

  This project aims to develop a standardized pipeline for processing event-related potentials (ERPs), particularly the P300
  component, using EEGLAB software. Key steps include data loading, filtering, re-referencing, and artifact removal, enhancing signal
  quality and reliability. The goal is to facilitate a deeper understanding of brain responses to stimuli in neurophysiological research.

# Design and Implementation of a Robotic Lego Packing Application

  This project develops an automated application using ABB IRB120 and Denso VS6556 robots for efficiently packaging Lego bricks.
  The system handles seven types of Lego bricks, allowing users to select specific toys and quantities for optimal box filling. It involves
  setting up coordinate systems for precise robot movements, managing a vacuum gripper for secure handling, and implementing a
  user-friendly interface. The automation enhances productivity and reduces manual labor, showcasing the effectiveness of robotics
  in toy packaging.

# Control and Trajectory Planning of a 2-DOF Robot

  This project focuses on the control and trajectory planning of a 2-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) robotic arm. It involves simulating the
  robot's movement between three points in space while applying various control strategies, including feedforward torque control
  and PD feedback. The simulation analyzes the robot's kinematics and dynamics, with particular attention to the impact of external
  forces and control parameters on performance. The goal is to achieve accurate and efficient movement while minimizing tracking
  errors.

Constraint stabilization method

  A small ball of mass m can slide without friction on a ring of radius R. The ring rotates with an angular velocity Î© about
  vertical axis passing through its center. The system is located in the constant gravitational field of the Earth.
  Consider that the hoop is fixed so that its only degree of freedom is rotation around a vertical axis passing through
  its center.
  Choose arbitrary numerical values for the radius of the hoop and the mass of the ball. Using the Lagrangian approach,
  derive the equations of motion under the appropriate constraint (the ball slides on a circular hoop) and present them in
  in the form of a system of differential equations. Convert the algebraic constraint equation into a differential equation
  using the constraint stabilization method. Depending on the angular velocity of the hoop, determine the stable position
  balance balls. For the case of small oscillations around each tested equilibrium position, display graphics.
