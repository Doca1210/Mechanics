Constraint stabilization method

  A small ball of mass m can slide without friction on a ring of radius R. The ring rotates with an angular velocity Î© about
  vertical axis passing through its center. The system is located in the constant gravitational field of the Earth.
  Consider that the hoop is fixed so that its only degree of freedom is rotation around a vertical axis passing through
  its center.
  Choose arbitrary numerical values for the radius of the hoop and the mass of the ball. Using the Lagrangian approach,
  derive the equations of motion under the appropriate constraint (the ball slides on a circular hoop) and present them in
  in the form of a system of differential equations. Convert the algebraic constraint equation into a differential equation
  using the constraint stabilization method. Depending on the angular velocity of the hoop, determine the stable position
  balance balls. For the case of small oscillations around each tested equilibrium position, display graphics.
